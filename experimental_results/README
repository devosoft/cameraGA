Target number of cameras for controls was set to 54.
Control types 0 (block centers) and 1 (random stratified) can have different number of cameras than desired, because of the nature of grid building.
Control types 1 (random) and 2 (opportunistic) always had 54 cameras.
Fitness functions 1 and 4 were not run on individuals, only on groups (west, east, F104-F105, F101-F108).

n = 3 for individuals (M114,M115,F116) -- all of whom wore GPS collars
n = 2 for social groups (F104 + F105, F101 + F108)
n = 2 for sub-populations / multiple adjacent groups (M115 + F116; F101 + F108, F110, F104 + F105) (2 groups; 3 groups)
